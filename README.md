# Data-Science-Projects EDA
 The projects I've done over the course of time for praticing my EDA and Data Science Skills. You can check the code out and also learn!
 


**2. Flights Prices - Analysis** ‚û°Ô∏è Another dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction), all about flight prices. I did a very comprehensive EDA on it. It was fun as I learned many new plots and explored!!


**3. Salary Dataset - Analysis** ‚û°Ô∏è It was an awsome project, truely loved it. It was regading some salaries of devs in India. It was a small dataset, yet you could do so much! Check it out to see what I did!


**4. Forbes Richest Poeple - Analysis** ‚û°Ô∏è Ahh, didn't go so well - actually got bored. The project still isn't complete. If you find it interesting, feel free to comeplete the project. I'd love the contibution!!


**5. Netflix TV Shows and Movies - Analysis** ‚û°Ô∏è My favourite most project ever. I did this as a part of Certification by [Jovain](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas). I learned a lot from it, like A LOT. I used many plots, purely from matplotlib. It was really a decent project, which took me around 3 days to complete but totally worth it!


**6. Tradyflow - Analysis** ‚û°Ô∏è This dataset was obtained from [tradytics.com](https://tradytics.com/trady-flow) on the date **21st June 2022**. It could be possible by the time you get the code, you might not find the dataset on the website **tradytics.com** except for this Github repo. This project was very fun to do. This was the first project in which I used pandas a lot. From basic manipulation to detailed and deep filtering. It took me a few days but was totally worth it. Loved and totally enjoyed it.


**7. Iris Dataset - Analysis** ‚û°Ô∏è I thought, I should do some EDA on this dataset. First due to it's popualrity and secondly to pratice EDA on a very small dataset, as such as this one. This was a slighly diffcult project, due to it's sheer simplicity. It's kinda hard to figure out what to plot, but I luckily figured out a lot of things to plot; this helped me figure out hidden patterns between the dataset. I also learned to use many new plots like KDE plot, Box plots and many many more! Check it out, you just might learn something new. 


**8. Titanic - EDA from sheer Disaster** ‚û°Ô∏è Well, the widely known [Titanic Dataset by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). I had to do some EDA on this. I have used many new and updated plots in this project as I had actually refreshed my Seaborn memory, thanks to Derek Benas, I was able to make some dope visualizations. Go have a look and let me know how it is! I'm sure you'll love it and hopefully learn as well!


**9. California Housing Dataset - Analysis** ‚û°Ô∏è You must have surely heard of this beauty. The CA dataset is awesome for begginer data scientists to check their skills! Totally begginer freindly and very intuitive as well as fun to use. This dataset also helped to refine my **data-cleaning** skills, which I must say is a very crucial part to Exploratory Data Analysis. I enjoyed playing with this jem! Al


**10. Mobile Prices - Analysis** ‚û°Ô∏è This may not be the best EDA out of these projects here, but should do the trick. The main purpose of this dataset was to get my hands dirty regarding Data Cleaning and I was able to do so. Hopefully the next project will be much much better - containing many more and improved visualizations!


## How to run the code?
Well, just [download](https://github.com/muhammadanas365/Data-Science-Projects---EDA/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repo and fire up your terminal. Fire up your terminal, type in `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Once completed, run `jupyter notebook`. This will open up a browser window as shown. Click on any folder and open the file inside that folder!

## Contributions
Am always open to pull requests and contributions. I'll surely add them in the project! Fork it and feel free to add whatever you want, even if it is a basic 2-D Bar graph ü§ùüèª

## Lisence
Feel Free to use this code anywhere you'd like! But if you do make any changes, do let me know so I can add that feature in the project! Ofcourse, if you want me to!
